By accessing or using FluentPort, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”).

FluentPort is currently in beta, and while we strive to provide a reliable service, you acknowledge that the service may experience interruptions, bugs, or limitations as it is still being developed. By using the Service, you accept the potential risks associated with its beta status.

If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not access or use FluentPort.

## 4. Description of the Service
### 4.1 General
FluentPort is a remote port forwarding service that allows users to publish local services for anyone to access. It can provide a quick and reasonable way to facilitate remote connections to local services. However, FluentPort is not a substitute for professional port forwarding or professional publishing of local services.
### 4.2 Remote port forwarding
The way FluentPort allows for publishing local services is using remote port forwarding. Publishing a local service might not always be secure and poses potential danger (e.g. unauthorized access, data interception, etc.) especially if done incorrectly. We recommend securing your local services before use and ensuring that the underlying local service is adequately secured. By using this service, you acknowledge that you understand the risks associated with remote port forwarding and take full responsibility for any security implications.
